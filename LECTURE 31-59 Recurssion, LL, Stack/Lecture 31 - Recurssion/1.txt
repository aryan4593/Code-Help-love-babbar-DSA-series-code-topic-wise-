when a function calls itself is known as recurssion

if big/complex problem solution is depend on same problem's small solution
ex. problem - 2^n
2^n = 2*2^n-1
f(n)=2*f(n-1)       ..recurssive relation

factorial - 
5! = 5 * 4!
    4!=4*3!
    3! = 3*2!
    2! = 2*1!
    1!= 1*0!
    0! = 1  we know this and it is called as base case in recursssion
f(n)=n* f(n-1);

base case in prev ex - 2^0 =1;


#note - writing return in base case is mandatory

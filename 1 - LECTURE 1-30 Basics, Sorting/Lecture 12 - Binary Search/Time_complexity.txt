for time complexity , we take worst case


let array of n size
        after first iteration
N/2 size
        after 2nd iteration
N/4 size
                .
                .
                .
                .
        after Kth iteration where only one size
N/(2^k)



N/(2^k)=1
so.. N = 2^K
     Log N = k Log 2
    
     so compolexity is K = Log(N)

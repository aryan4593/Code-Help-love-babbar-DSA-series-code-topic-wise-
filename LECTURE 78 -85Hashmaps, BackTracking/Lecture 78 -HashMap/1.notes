It is useful because it have very less T.C for insert,search etc

it contains key value pairs

2 types of map -> ordered and unordered
        orderd hav O(log n) complexities where unordered have O(1)
Hashtable is used to implement it unordered map

Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.

Hashing involves mapping data to a fixed size using hash functions. The output, known as a hash code, is typically a number.

Properties of a good hash function:
- It should be fast to compute.
- It should distribute keys uniformly across the hash table.
- It should minimize collisions (where two keys hash to the same index).

Common hash functions include division-remainder, multiplication, and universal hashing.

Applications of hashing:
- Implementing data structures like hash tables, hash maps, and sets.
- Cryptography for secure data transmission.
- Data retrieval and storage optimization.

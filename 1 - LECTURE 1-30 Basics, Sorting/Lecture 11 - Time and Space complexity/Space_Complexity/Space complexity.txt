It is the amount of space
taken by algorithm to run as a function of length of the input

#check memory taken for space complexity


for making amy variable --> O(1)

ex. int arr[5]={2,3,3,2,58} --> O(n)

ex.2 int n;
     cin>>n;
     vector<int> V(N)  --> o(N)

ex.3 
     for (0-n){
          vector <int> v(n);      --> O(n)

          for (0-n){

          }
     }

at any instant of time we get n block of memories so space complexity is O(n)

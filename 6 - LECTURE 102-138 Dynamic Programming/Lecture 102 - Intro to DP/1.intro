Those who forgets the path are condemned to repeat it

1.Top Down approach  -> recurssion + Memoization
2.Bottom Up approach -> Tabulation

when to apply dp?
when we can find optimal solution of a problem using it subProblem
and we should also have overlapping subProblem in it

Memoization is saving value 



Tabulation steps
0th step - create dp array
write base case 
convert recursive call into normal dp calls see Tabulation.cpp

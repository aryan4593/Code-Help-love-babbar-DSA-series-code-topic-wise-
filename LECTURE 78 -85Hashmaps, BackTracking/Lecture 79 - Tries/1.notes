it is type of data structure

worse case of hashmap is o(k) to implement dict

TrieNode{
    char data;
    TrieNode* children[26];
    bool isTerMinalNode;
}


why hashmap is better to store?
ex. i have to store  ARE, ARM , ARENA , ARDENO
    for hasmap it will take extra space as it will create mapping for every word but for TrieNode

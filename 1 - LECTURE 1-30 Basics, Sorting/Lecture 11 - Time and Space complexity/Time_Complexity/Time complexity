It is the amount of time taken by algorithm to run as a function of length of the input

Why? -
for making better oprogram 
Comparison of algorithm

Notation -  Big O,                      Theta 0 ,               Omega
            for upper bound     for average complexity      Lower bound

constant time --> O(1)
lineaer time --> O(n)
logarithmic stime --> O(logn)
Quadratic time -->O(n^2)
cubic time --> O(n^3)

            stack, heap memory concept in this way we use stack  memory, which is defined before runtime
            but if we input large no. stack memory can get fulled
*/

//correct way - use heap memory;

//If you want use heap memory we have to use NEW key word *****

// use of stack memory - static allocation
// use of heap memory - dynamic memory allocation

//heap memory returns address, we can;t name those memory
// to do this we have to use pointer

Dijekstr'as algo don't work for -ve edges

that's why we hav this : Bellman Ford Algorithm

condition - graph shouldn't have -ve cycle

      A
     ^ \
  6 /   \ -12
   /     v
   B <--- C
      -8


B->C = -6
but when u traverse again i.e BACBAC dist keep getting less -20,-28... so on
this is negative cycle

We can find negative cycle using this Bellman ford algo

this algo is for directed graph





we have to apply n-1 times for all edges

if dist[u] + wt < dist [v]
    then dist [v] = dist[u] + wt ;


then apply formula one more time ,
here if any dist gets updated means negative cycle exists in graph

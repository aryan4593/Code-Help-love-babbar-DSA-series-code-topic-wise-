What is selection sort?

--> diffeent rounds or passes
--> in every round we took smallest element and place it in right position


                         arr =  64,  25, 12, 22, 11
Round 1   i=0; swap (64,11)     11,  25, 12, 22, 64          // as 11 is min of arr (i to n)
round 2   i=1;  swap(12,25)     11,  12, 25, 22, 64         // as 12 is min of arr (i to n)
round 3 i=2;    swap(22,25)     11,  12, 22, 25, 64             .....

total round = n-1

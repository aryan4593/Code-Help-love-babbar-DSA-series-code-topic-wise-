Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sorting:

we use BFS here

    2
  /   \
1       > 5 -->4
  \   /
    3

adj list - 
1 -> 2 , 3
2 -> 5
3 -> 5
4 -> 
5 -> 4

step 1 - find in Degree of all nodes
step 2 - insert all element with 0 indegree in queue
step 3 - perform bfs and processing decrease indegree of neb by 1 as we have removed it's parent
